Identify resected contacts with Implantation data and resection volume surface 

1/Exports cortical and resection surfaces to STL files from brainstorm anatomy data

2/Loads a resection mask and prepares it as a closed 3D volume

3/Checks whether implanted electrode contacts lie inside the resection volume and generates a ParaView Python script to visualize them
